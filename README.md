# deepBrain model for brain signals decoding
End-to-end speech synthesis from ECoG data recorded from epilepsy patients in the Universit√§tsklinikum Freiburg using Deep Neural Networks.
The model architecture is based on recent speech recognition models such as the deepSpeech 2 model https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595.
